This is a platformer I am currently working on. It is written in love2d.

Then go to this folder and run "love ."

- Add enemies
 - Spikes
 - ?
 
- Add interative objects

 - Bounce-platform
 
- Engine Stuff
 - Solve 0.99-Problem for collision
 X Add Sprite Engine
 - Clean up player-movement
 - Write generic collision test
 - Generalize controls -> Pass keypressed to spriteEngine
 - To test: Do walls stick, if jumped to from below?
