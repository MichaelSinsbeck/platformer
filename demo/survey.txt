Does world 1 "feel" consistent? Is the number of (background) objects right?

Do the shaders work on your system? (Shaders are used to fade to gray scale when the player dies)

Did you find any bugs? Anything that didn't work as you expected?

In case you used the fullscreen mode, did it work?

Further extensions
------------------
We are considering a map editor and the functionality to share user made levels over the internet.
Would you use a level-editor if we shipped the game with one?

If so, would you share your levels online if there was a "share" feature?
